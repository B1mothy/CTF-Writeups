Challenge Description: I was hiking in the woods when I stumbled across this amazing thing: thousands of these orange structures! I stopped to take a photo but then this cat _had_ to photo bomb my otherwise perfect photo with it's tail! Can you find where this photo was taken?

There's a few important things to note from this picture:
- left hand curve ahead
- text on pillars
- pole in the road
- some type of structure off to the right
- pavement type

A google image search tells us the location is '**Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine** in Kyoto, Japan'. Perfect we have a general area. 

Just searching this into the google maps will give us a nice area to go off of, but this area has no street view... Hovering the character icon in the bottom right over surrounding areas WITH street view I came across the 'Shirahata-ko Shrine'. Going into street view on a matching trail, the first thing I noticed was you can only see the text going away from the shrine, so we know we know are heading west.

Keeping this in mind and the fact we are looking at a left hand turn, lets look on street view for any left-hand turns going West.

We have 3 potential spots, lets try the 1st:

Too narrow, no poles, or opening to the forest.

Same pole in the walkway, structure off to the right, left hand turn, and text on the wall. Instantly knew this was it, now just move to up a little in street view and take the cords from the URL, BAM!
